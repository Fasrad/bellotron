Create PostScript line drawings for camera bellows fabric patterns

The camera bellows pattern I'm using is a hybrid of several techniques
I saw online and what I found to work from making the bellows myself.

In general bellows can be tapered from the rear (larger typically) to the
front the rear camera
standards. We may also wish the pleats to taper in size from the rear
to the front of the the camera.


The essential definitions are the (folded) inner and outer height and 
width of the bellows at the front and rear
